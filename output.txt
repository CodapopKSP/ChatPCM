You're taking the word of the law. It's not about how strictly certain laws are being repealed, it's about how specific laws are being repealed. For example, US v. disingenuous gun laws that were repealed are being repealed.\n\nYou can't drop a broad definition of a term like police into one single one. That's like a serial killer talking about how a term for sex happened. That's not what the law is about. That's not what the Constitution is 
about. That's different than fleeing to Russia because they constantly called you that Russia sends you.

I mean, theres a reason the founding fathers were mostly Auth. They kept their distance behind a common tax base to fund their economy and industry, something to strive for in a free society.\n\nThe tax base wasnt tied to income either. They could make a profit on the land, and if they sold the land to a person, they would get tax back from the sale, but they would never profit from the sale.\n\nThe main reason income tax is tied to the type 
of land, and not to the income you are paying for it.

Most of those jobs are unskilled.\n\n2) You need to lower the cost of doing business. Not because of higher wages, but because the skilled worker has better options in negotiating their future.

Honestly I feel like the modern left is more concerned about having some more comfort in their populace than actually taking full advantage of the lower classes. I feel like this system is more concerned about having the least amount of comfort in the peasant, and being the most comfortable in anyone else.\n\nBasically what the other movement or people are making up are rational actors in society who need to be brought up to the masses, and the most rational actors are people who need to be brought up to the masses.\n\nBasically the idea is that the lower classes need to be brought up out of thin air, and the disenfranchised need to be removed. This way the upper class is completely rationalized, while the upper classes have their minds to keep reaping the consequence of their NazBolts.

God is God. God is the second-center of the universe. The universe is his work because of two gods, the one in the center, the one with a metaphorically human children. We can't do it, because it'd be impossible to do so in the real world. The only way we could do it is if a deity opens fire on us, killing our children and worshiping the one who opens the gates of hell. It's called being a first-mover God, and it's not difficult to understand why you'd even say that in a Christian context.\n\nLibLeft: God is the second-cobalt- age God, and the first-rate in the world. The universe is made up of conscious beings that are divine in their ability to comprehend the realities of existence and to think and act like animals. We can't make up the behalfwment of one particular being because it's incredibly difficult to comprehend the realities of existence and how they made things if we allow them to create and maintain it. The reality is that humans are rational because we can comprehend it and because humans are supposed to be rational we should try to make up the baphuck not because we have to kill every innocent human because they're bad at killing

Furthermore, the man was a philosophical snob: he didn't understand that people had to vote for him: he didn't debate; he didn't respect the weakness of power; he didn't \"like\" being challenged; he didn't give a fuck about his ideas andRL political elites; he just wanted to grill.\n\nReagan's failures are blamed on conservatives, and he's blamed on the left.

The Indians, in their more violent ways, were considered a violent people and genocided. They adopted their own language and religion and so were usually strict veils of history. The language of the Indians was not very violent. The religion was close to a cult of personality which was very common in the later centuries of history. The violence was often physical and often endemically done by the tribe or the culture. The only difference today are sure but it is a living breed of the moment. The peaceful and contented land give way to violent and insular living.

1. You don't know how fast an area's road systems are to get to and leave without understanding them and not realizing they're there. You think people are going to follow rules instead of just going along the road and then 
stopping, walking behind a paywalls in the middle of a major city while drinking your beer and committing a crime? Yeah, that's not accepted, but how do you expect the government to keep your country's money-getters from fucking over the environment by controlling what is and isn't money making by funding environmental think tanks and their research for the past 50 years?  \n2. You think that the United States is different from most countries. You think people would do a better job of roads if they were all abolished, while every other country was left with roads only being built when a significant amount of the population was already healthy and old enough to 
work the roads?  \n3. You're not American. You think that the United States is different from every other country. You think people who aren't getting their money's support from the taxes that were obligated or will be cancelled by your government when you don't give it to them?  \n4. You're not a Euro. You think that the United States is the only country that can afford roads that are so cheap that you pay a miserable lot of taxes to do so? 
 \n5. I'm not American. I live in the US. You're not Euro, you're Americans. You're Americans do sometimes complain about the US government's treatment of the eurocuck Americans, but they're in no way Euro to begin with. The US government fucks us over at a place of the size of New York, and all of the selfish peado you're worse than on Wall Street by being a Euro peado.\n\nYour entire take on the US government's treatment of the eurocuck is 
just andwing on the American border to the American piss, and I feel like I'd rather hear about it than the Euro peado. Please stop spoutingeuro-cuck nonsense, and instead reason with your heart.

I agree with you, but the key is just to add to the discussion, suicide is not the case for non-trans people. To me, just because theyre trans, doesnt mean Im right. Also, suicide is not an illness, just a state of being. \n\nAnd before anyone brings attention to the fact that being trans is there. To me, its the person who chose to transition. And thats all I need. Im happy with what I am. If someone disagrees with me then theyre against me. But the people who do oppose me dont agree with me either.

It's because of the way the wage gap is explained by gender pay gap: women receive more in the workplace than men. In fact, according to the article, \"more women are expected to work than men in the private sector, despite a lack of equal labor luck.\"\n\nHowever, this isn't true for every female case worker safety officer is actually held responsible for taking home less than her male counterparts, or the average male case worker is more likely to quit than a female cop because \"less quit\" means less time off, less benefits and less benefits for female employees.\n\nIt's why I strongly oppose any measure that increases or decreases the cost of men's sole positions, and especially for minorities. It's not fair to give a man a bad title buddy when a woman's a bad buddy, it's fair to make the title buddy a woman's chosen, and especially better IMO than the man's sole buddy.\n\nIt's an issue I'm willing to have my voice be told and addressed, and for which I pay the cost of actually trying to get behind in person and get resources to actually help men get past their sexual harassment/obscureatty issues, or even just do something that actually improves men's lives, like advocating for more women in general, getting them on our side, or even just actually actually actually actually actually actually fucking pushing for better male equality.\n\nI'm sure I deserve an award for my efforts in these difficult times, but this is what I'm doing as well, and to this day I have not gotten one, obviously. I owe my time and efforts to men, and I wish you all the best;\n\nYou should care more about my personal feelings about how I'm supposed to advance my ideology, even if I don't do that. I simply don't care and will not do anything that will lead to this bullshit title.\n\nNo one that is going to talk about it and take a bunch of these conversations that I'm going to be doing with my buddies at the McArts is going to be happy to listen to me talk about my ideology.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and prove that point. There is a difference between gender and sex. Sex is a reproductive trait, but it includes that part of the brain. A man taking a shit in his pants and being pregnant for the baby means you're not one of the women. A man being pregnant means one of the men have to have a gun and be a man. I don't give a shit if a woman wants to abort a baby because, you know, that's it. But if a woman does something like that, that's another women's fault, and they should be punished.

Wait are you saying people who build too are choosing to live somewhere that is not actually walkable? If so, why? How do you come to your own conclusion of why you choose to live somewhere that is not walkable?\n\nI feel like people who build too near houses of all types is just being a bad faith of what people want but youre literally not going to convince them by going in that direction. There are even instances where people get violent and kill themselves due to just simply being in a position where they can hear someone backing them. And I dont know any gypsies unfortunately. That being said, I highly doubt anyone wouldnt personally kick them out of their 
home if they could speak up about it. Its just good luck living in a forest and walking corpse.

I think theres a lot of truth to the story that suggests theres a lot of male politicians and bureaucrats having a huge impact on the perception and perception of women in society. \n\nA good portion of those women definitely took advantage of the male power dynamic. For example an ex gf I worked with ended up going to every girl Im attracted too hard with, it wasnt because she was a woman (which she was in the closet a man was in her life), 
she even knew I was attracted to the man in the closet too. They all spoke to me in shitty excuse excuse and I would just claim I knew what they were talking about.\n\nIts not really disingenuous to also say that men are more likely to vote Democrat orplying with their male powerjaces. If you cant name every girl I worked with youre probably pretty low-key mentally ill r*****.

A car is a great tool for getting from work, but its limited as it can be used multiple times. Plus you need to be able to tell which side of the road is which when a car is used to cross the road it can be used for avoiding theft. You also need to have a functional road, which is why I think we should have some right over small car based cars, but that is such a naive and cringy idea of how cars work.\n\nAlso, youre saying that because cities are designed for cars, there is a trade off.

>2.) That seems very much like a different issue tbh. Why are there so many homeless people and why are they so aggressive?\n\n1. they don't actively take advantage of people who don't want to live with the people on the street. e.g. a homeless person doesn't actively go to a homeless camp and is therefore treated as a \"tyronicist\"\n2. the homeless are by definition mentally ill, not addicted to the homeless. if they commit suicide, or if they kill themselves and have non-consent to support them, or if they're homeless and are harassing or have non-consent, then they're a mentally ill person.\n3. I'm sure you don't want to restrict or punish homeless people in any way by enforcing your personal values. \n4. I don't really.

I mean, the whole problem of housing, and of course the whole idea of building housing for the population, is that it's harder to build. The reason why high density housing is a thing is because there's simply no other better option.\n\nI'm not saying you don't have a right to a place of relative useless employment, but you don't have a right to a safe place of public employment if you're not prepared to build something effective and comfortable enough to support that job. And that's not even gonna be an option for only the people who need it, so there's going to be people who are going to be sent to the job who just want to live on the street and there's going to be no other option.\n\nAnd I don't think this is just \"Dont complain about the job market and blame boomer politicians\". I think it's that the entire western world is dealing with this job shortage in a situation of retocracy. And that's a lot more moderate than \"you can't build a building and take it away from private property\".

I don't think you're entirely wrong, but I think the impact on people is minimal when comparing the two, and more than likely much greater when you make the same data from it, when you say \"the only reason\" is that people are comparing things based on how much power is available to them instead of having to choose between one or the other, i.e. people who are willing to pay more for data willingly allowing them to choose.

I agree with the nuclear one. I think the solution is toCenter the industry and push technology outside of the industrial revolution. For example, we should encourage the waste collection industry. There is enough natural waste that could be used for nuclear weapons production and research. There is also enough industrial activity that could be used to generate power. There is enough waste that the quality of nuclear power is increased. There is enough carbon in the water to make up for the cost of power production. There is enough land to make up for the cost of maintainment. There is enough land that farming is possible. If all the land were virgin, the population would grow to about 7 billion, the world could fall in the pandemic, and people would live closer to the equator due to greater population size. The west and the east would all become Socialist Manchuria instead of Socialist Manchuria instead of Socialist USSR.

I can get on board with that. I'm of the opinion that the government should be actively held accountable for their efforts to serve their people, but the nature and outcomes of such efforts should not beTLized, no matter how much you end up supporting them for doing better. That's not to say I'm against some police, but if you start attacking the police and *just* not helping, that's just an ill-informed statement.\n\nI'd love to hear a reasonable take, but I'm just giving the benefit of the doubt that the focus and rhetoric of the US police force *shouldn't* be on the treatment of civilians in the US military. That's not to say I support police brutality, but 
that treatment by the police in general is badly managed. There's nothing wrong with police as in \"they're just a bunch of bad apples\"; people will just bring their dogs to a poor beating of the old days.\n\n>I'd love to

I think we should treat the citizens well where it doesn't effect them and as a whole understand why they're being so 
susceptible to bad policing. I think we're going to have to get rid of excessive force in public, which I don't think we can accomplish, but I think we can treat that problem with more drastically lessuses force and that's

I mean, the whole reason its so popular to make a point like making black men as oppressed is because black people were oppressed for shit like slavery, and making a point like making black people as oppressed is just making a point to counter slavery. Its making a point because its not really that they care about their ancestors having to work harder or be treated equally, its all about them and their identity.  \n\nIts even worse when you look at the past and see past white people being a more important group of people than the past white peoples, its like the white people of today, theyre still shamed for being so white and privileged, their identity is being subverted and theyre no longer needed.  \n\n\nIf you just try to make an argument for why they didnt deserve to win a huge silver core of white people, shit will hit the fan, because any argument that says any of these things is just another hedgied billi pie in the sky conspiracy will be shut down as unproductive.
